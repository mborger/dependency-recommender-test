= Nebula Dependency Recommender Test

== Failure scenario
I am expecting the composite build to work from `app` because `lib` also defines a recommendation bom.

----
$ app> ./gradlew run --include-build ../lib

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Could not determine the dependencies of task ':run'.

I would like to have this work with Gradle 4.1 but I also tried 3.5.1 with the same results.
